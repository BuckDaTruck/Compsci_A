The principle of quantum entanglement, as articulated by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in their famous EPR paradox, demonstrates that two particles can become correlated in such a way that the measurement of one instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of the physical distance between them, providing insight into the profound intricacies of quantum mechanics.
